# customMetrics

This example serves as a deeper dive into C3 Metrics in general. We'll look at defining CompoundMetrics as well as creating new metrics with TSDeclMetrics.

Create an appropriate environment using the conda environment file `env.yaml` or use that file to inform the creation of an appropriate environment via another means.

Once ready, launch `jupyter notebook` and open the `customMetrics.ipynb` notebook.

This exercise requires a C3 cluster to work properly. Please ensure you either run this on a C3 jupyter instance already connected to a cluster, or you fill in the necessary information in the `get_c3` notebook cell.
